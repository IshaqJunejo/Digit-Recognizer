# Digit-Recognizer

A Basic Neural Network Trained on the infamous MNIST dataset.

This Neural Network takes input as `784` pixels, has a hidden layer of `10` Neurons and an Output layer of `10` Neurons representing each Digit. Having a Total of `7960` parameters.

Neural Network after being Trained have it's parameters stored into `Dataset.json` file to be able to extract the parameters and test the performance. During Testing it's performance result varies generally from `80%` to `90%` accuracy.
